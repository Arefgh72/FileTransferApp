# transfer_core/__init__.py - This file makes the directory a Python subpackage.
# It can be empty if you are using direct imports within the subpackage (e.g., from .helpers import ...).
# Alternatively, you can import specific items here to make them available directly under the package name,
# e.g., from .helpers import CancelledError
# from .handlers import handle_client_connection
# from .clients import send_file_task
# etc.
# For this project structure, keeping it empty is sufficient as other modules will use explicit imports.
